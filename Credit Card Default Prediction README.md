## Credit Card Default Prediction ##

This analysis explores the credit default dataset with the objective of predicting whether a credit card holder will default on their payments. The dataset consists of 23 input variables, including credit amount, demographic factors (gender, education, marital status, age), payment history, and financial transactions, all of which contribute to assessing credit risk.

To achieve this goal, I follow a structured methodology that involves data exploration, model construction, evaluation, and final model selection. The key steps in my approach are as follows:

### Data Exploration & Preprocessing ###

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: Checking for missing values, handling duplicates, and exploring the relationships between variables. 
2. Model Building: Constructing Decision Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.
3. Model Evaluation: Comparing the performance of different models on the validation set using Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score through a summary table. 
4. Final Model Selection: Choosing the best-performing model for further evaluation of the unseen data (test set).

Throughout this analysis, I utilize visualizations and statistical techniques to enhance interpretability. My goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that can be practically applied in the financial industry, aiding institutions in making informed lending decisions and mitigating credit risk.

This project not only strengthens my technical skills in data science and machine learning, but also deepens my understanding of real-world financial applications. ðŸš€
