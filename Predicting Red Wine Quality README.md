## Predicting Red Wine Quality: A Data-Driven Approach ##

This analysis explores the red wine dataset with the objective of predicting wine quality based on key physicochemical attributes. The dataset includes variables such as volatile acidity, chlorides, total sulfur dioxide, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content, which are known to influence wine quality.

To achieve this goal, I follow a structured methodology that involves data exploration, model construction, evaluation, and final model selection. The key steps in my approach are as follows:

### Data Exploration & Preprocessing ###

Checking for missing values and handling duplicates.
Analyzing correlations between features to identify key predictors.
Standardizing or transforming variables where necessary.
Model Building

Linear Regression (M1): Establishing a baseline predictive model.
Polynomial Regression (M2, M3, M4): Exploring non-linear relationships between features and wine quality.
k-Nearest Neighbors (M5): Optimizing the hyperparameter k to enhance predictive performance.
Model Evaluation

Using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to compare model accuracy on validation and test sets.
Identifying patterns in prediction errors to refine model performance.
Final Model Selection

Choosing the best-performing model (Mb) for further evaluation and insights.
Interpreting key predictors of wine quality to provide actionable insights.
Throughout this analysis, I utilize visualizations and statistical techniques to enhance interpretability. My goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that can be practically applied in the wine industry, helping producers understand the factors that contribute to high-quality wine.

This project not only reinforces my technical skills in data science, regression modeling, and machine learning, but also deepens my understanding of real-world applications in the finance and consumer goods sectors. ðŸš€
